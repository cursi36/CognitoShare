This folder contains notes on commonly used algorithms for **Reinforcement Learning**.

The notes briefly describe RL in general and provide an example on how to use **Q Learning** in a simple scenario.

The notes also explore **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, with examples of methods such as:

- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**
- **Actor-Critic method**
- **Vanilla Policy Gradient (PG)**
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**
- **Proximal Policy Opitmization (PPO)**
